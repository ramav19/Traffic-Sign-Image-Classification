# Traffic-Sign-Image-Classification

Autonomous Vehicles will soon be available in the not so distant future. Traffic sign detection and classification is a very important aspect for such vehicles. Traditional ML algorithms take a long time to offer suitable predictions. 
We have used Convolutional Neural Networks which process the data over GPUs to provide results at a fraction of the time as compared to general ML algorithms.
